# Dependencies
Install all dependence in `pygooglenews.py`. 

Depending on Python versions and if you want to much around with conflicting dependency versions, you can also use the following quick installation but make sure to run `pip install setuptools==58` (which might also mess up other dependencies like `feedparser`).
Install PyGoogleNews at https://github.com/kotartemiy/pygooglenews#about using `pip install pygooglenews --upgrade`.
